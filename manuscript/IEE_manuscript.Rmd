# Summary stats from the esa2012 tweets
These are some summaries on tweets tagged `#esa2012` between mid-July and mid-August. There were approximately 4905 tweets about the conference (still waiting on the raw data) but I was able to scrape some analytics data from the [Topsy API](http://code.google.com/p/otterapi/). I have additional information on the most popular links, photos and videos from the conference but have not summarized those.

Please note that these results aren't ready to be shared yet (barely scratched the surface) but do watch the repository for updates.
