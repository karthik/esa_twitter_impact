## Introduction
The use of Twitter and other social media now plays an important role in scientific conferences. Often the conference attendees or  the organizers decide upon a descriptive hashtag to serve as an identifier for tweets related to conference events (e.g. #esa2012). This allows anyone to follow a public tweets matching that tag, rather than following individual users in order to get updates on highlights, research soundbites, and a general pulse of a conference. The popularity of Twitter as a means of extending scientific discourse and taking advantage of other benefits that meetings confer, such as networking opportunities, collaborations etc have increased in recent years [citation]. The recent ecological society meeting held in Portland, Oregon between August 5th and 10th, 2012 was the largest meeting in attendence thus far. It was also the most tweeted meeting. To quantitatively analyze the impact twitter on the meeting, we obtained all tweets tagged esa2012 and alayzed various scientific metrics about it.
