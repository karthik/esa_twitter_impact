# The use of Twitter increases the effectiveness of a large society conference.

__Karthik Ram__ and __Christopher J. Lortie__


## Introduction


## Data and analyses
We obtained the raw list of all tweets tagged with the hashtag \#ESA2012. Since Twitter only archives the last 1500 tweets for any individual user or a hashtag, we used a third party twitter archiving service, Topsy, to gain access to all tweets. We targeted the window of data from two weeks before the conference to two weeks after to capture the early enthusiam prior to the meeting but also the extended conversations happening right after the meeting before the use of the tag trailed off (see figure 1).

# Summary stats from the esa2012 tweets
These are some summaries on tweets tagged `#esa2012` between mid-July and mid-August. There were approximately 4905 tweets about the conference (still waiting on the raw data) but I was able to scrape some analytics data from the [Topsy API](http://code.google.com/p/otterapi/). I have additional information on the most popular links, photos and videos from the conference but have not summarized those. 

Please note that these results aren't ready to be shared yet (barely scratched the surface) but do watch the repository for updates.
